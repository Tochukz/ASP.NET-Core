# CoreReactRedux 
This project was created using the _ASP.NET Core with React.js and Redux_ template.  
The project configures a Single Page Application (SPA) using React.js as the SPA library with Redux installed and configured. 
The version of React used may not be the latest version and may need to be upgraded.  
At the time of writing the latest version of React is version 17.x but version 16.x was used in the template 
The components in the SPA are class bases components not functional base components. 
The React team now recommends functional based componenst, using React hooks, over class based components.
