# Core Web App 
This project was created using the _ASP.NET Core Web App_  template.  
This project template is not an MVC project but a Web App of Razor Pages. 
It simply serves Razor pages defined in the Pages directory.  
You can easily add a new razor page(e.g AboutMe.cshtml) to the Pages directory.  
Every Razor page is made up of a `.cshtml` markup and a `.cs` code behind file.
